# Libft
My own Library of functions I made. I modify, improve and add 
new functions to improve my library and use it for my future
projects. The basic project was a 42 curriculum project, with 
time I implemented and added more of my own functions.

In order to comline the program you just run:
```bash
 make
```
my library will be compiled into .a file:
```bash
libft.a
```
